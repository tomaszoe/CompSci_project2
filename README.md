This repository contains the final report and scripts for project 2. It includes:

*  CompSciProject2-scripts.zip.zip_: A .zip file containing our data and a Jupyter Notebook in which all the figures of the report are created.
* _Project_2_CompSci.pdf_: The report for the project.
* _Project 2_CompSci.zipp_: The Latex source code for the report.
* _Project2_instructions.pdf_: The project instructions.

This project was a part of coursework for the CompSci doctoral program which is managed by the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences at the University of Oslo (UiO). The program is partly funded by the EU Horizon 2020 under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Act
